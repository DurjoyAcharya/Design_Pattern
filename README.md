<strong>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">Wikipedia</a>:
[A] software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring
problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be
transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how
to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are
formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems
when designing an application or system.</strong>

<strong>
There are many design patterns used in software development, but here are some of the most common ones:
<br>
Creational Patterns:<br>
Singleton Pattern<br>
Factory Method Pattern<br>
Abstract Factory Pattern<br>
Builder Pattern<br>
Prototype Pattern<br>
Structural Patterns:<br>
Adapter Pattern<br>
Bridge Pattern<br>
Composite Pattern<br>
Decorator Pattern<br>
Facade Pattern<br>
Flyweight Pattern<br>
Proxy Pattern<br>
Behavioral Patterns:<br>
Chain of Responsibility Pattern<br>
Command Pattern<br>
Interpreter Pattern<br>
Iterator Pattern<br>
Mediator Pattern<br>
Memento Pattern<br>
Observer Pattern<br>
State Pattern<br>
Strategy Pattern<br>
Template Method Pattern<br>
Visitor Pattern<br>
Concurrency Patterns:<br>
Active Object Pattern<br>
Barrier Pattern<br>
Double Checked Locking Pattern<br>
Guarded Suspension Pattern<br>
Immutable Pattern<br>
Monitor Object Pattern<br>
Reactor Pattern<br>
Readers-Writers Pattern<br>
Thread Pool Pattern<br>
These design patterns provide solutions for common problems that software developers face in the design and implementation of software systems. They provide a way to solve problems in a structured and repeatable manner, which makes software systems more maintainable, extensible, and scalable.
