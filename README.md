<strong>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">Wikipedia</a>:
[A] software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring
problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be
transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how
to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are
formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems
when designing an application or system.</strong>

There are many design patterns used in software development, but here are some of the most common ones:

Creational Patterns:
Singleton Pattern
Factory Method Pattern
Abstract Factory Pattern
Builder Pattern
Prototype Pattern
Structural Patterns:
Adapter Pattern
Bridge Pattern
Composite Pattern
Decorator Pattern
Facade Pattern
Flyweight Pattern
Proxy Pattern
Behavioral Patterns:
Chain of Responsibility Pattern
Command Pattern
Interpreter Pattern
Iterator Pattern
Mediator Pattern
Memento Pattern
Observer Pattern
State Pattern
Strategy Pattern
Template Method Pattern
Visitor Pattern
Concurrency Patterns:
Active Object Pattern
Barrier Pattern
Double Checked Locking Pattern
Guarded Suspension Pattern
Immutable Pattern
Monitor Object Pattern
Reactor Pattern
Readers-Writers Pattern
Thread Pool Pattern
These design patterns provide solutions for common problems that software developers face in the design and implementation of software systems. They provide a way to solve problems in a structured and repeatable manner, which makes software systems more maintainable, extensible, and scalable.
