<strong>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">Wikipedia</a>:
[A] software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring
problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be
transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how
to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are
formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems
when designing an application or system.</strong>
